A simple web application for creating and sharing tier lists of AI models. Drag and drop models between tiers (S, A, B, C, D, E, F) from an unranked pool.

## Features

*   **Drag & Drop Interface:** Easily move models between tiers.
*   **Default Models:** Includes a set of common AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to start with.
*   **Custom Models:** Add your own models with custom names and optional image URLs.
*   **Edit/Delete:** Double-click any model (default or custom) to edit its name/image or delete it.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Your tier list layout and custom models are saved in your browser's local storage.
*   **Reset:** Reset the list back to the initial default models and clear tiers.
*   **Share:** Generate a shareable link that encodes your current tier list state (layout and models).

## Inspiration

I couldn't see the absurd tier list maker in this video : "[Ranking every model based on my feelings](https://youtu.be/3yrAK2hMWw8?t=232)"
